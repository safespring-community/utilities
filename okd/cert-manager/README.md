This guide provides instructions for installing cert-manager with a webhook for Gandi DNS in your environment. Cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management, issuance, and renewal of certificates from various issuing sources. It will ensure your services are securely served over HTTPS within your cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you have the following:
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster with administrative privileges.
- The `helm` and `oc` (OpenShift CLI)  installed on your local machine. You can also replace all oc command with kubectl.
- A Gandi account and an API key for domain validation.

## Installation steps

### Step 1: Install cert-manager

1. **Create a Namespace**: Start by creating a namespace for cert-manager to organize its resources without cluttering other parts of your cluster.

   ```bash
   namespace="cert-manager"
   oc create namespace ${namespace} || true
   ```

2. **Add Helm Repositories**: Add the Jetstack and Sintef-Gandi helm repositories. These contain the charts needed to install cert-manager and the Gandi DNS webhook.

   ```bash
   helm repo -n ${namespace} add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
   helm repo -n ${namespace} add sintef-gandi https://sintef.github.io/cert-manager-webhook-gandi
   helm dependency build .
   ```
3. **Install cert-manager**: Use Helm to install cert-manager within the created namespace. This step also includes creating a secret for the Gandi API token which is required for DNS challenges.

   ```bash
   helm install -n ${namespace} cert-manager .

   # Replace '..........' with your actual Gandi API Key.
   #GANDI_KEY=..........
   oc create --namespace ${namespace} secret generic gandi-credentials  --from-literal=api-token="$(echo ${GANDI_KEY})"
   ```

### Step 2: Create ACME accounts

Cert-manager uses ACME protocol to automatically issue and renew certificates. You'll need to create accounts for both LetsEncrypt staging and production environments.

- **Staging Environment**: Useful for testing. Certificates issued from this environment are not trusted by browsers.
  ```yaml
  oc apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: ClusterIssuer
  metadata:
    name: letsencrypt-staging
  spec:
    acme:
      server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
      email: not-valid@safespring.com
      privateKeySecretRef:
        name: letsencrypt-staging
      solvers:
      - dns01:
          webhook:
            groupName: acme.bwolf.me
            solverName: gandi
            config:
              apiKeySecretRef:
                key: api-token
                name: gandi-credentials
  EOF
  ```

- **Production Environment**: Use this for obtaining trusted certificates after testing.
  ```yaml
  oc apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: ClusterIssuer
  metadata:
    name: letsencrypt
  spec:
    acme:
      server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
      email: not-valid@safespring.com
      privateKeySecretRef:
        name: letsencrypt
      solvers:
      - dns01:
          webhook:
            groupName: acme.bwolf.me
            solverName: gandi
            config:
              apiKeySecretRef:
                key: api-token
                name: gandi-credentials
  EOF
  ```

### Step 3: Requesting certificates

Request certificates for both your applications' ingress controller and the cluster API. Ensure to customize the `dnsNames` field with your cluster's domain details.

- **Applications Ingress Controller**: This certificate will secure your applications accessible via the ingress.

  ```yaml
  oc apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: Certificate
  metadata:
    name: apps-wildcard-staging
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  spec:
    dnsNames:
    - '*.apps.<cluster_name>.<domain>'
    issuerRef:
      kind: ClusterIssuer
      name: letsencrypt-staging
    secretName: apps-wildcard-tls-staging
  EOF
  ```

- **Cluster API**: This certificate is for securing the Kubernetes API server.
  ```yaml
  oc apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: Certificate
  metadata:
    name: api-staging
    namespace: openshift-config
  spec:
    dnsNames:
    - 'api.<cluster_name>.<domain>'
    issuerRef:
      kind: ClusterIssuer
      name: letsencrypt-staging
    secretName: api-tls-staging
  EOF
  ```

### Step 4: Patching controllers

To use the requested certificates, patch the default ingress controller and the API server with the names of the secrets where the certificates are stored.

- **Default Ingress Controller**:

  To see if certificate is ready to be used:
  ```bash
  oc wait --timeout=200s -n openshift-ingress --for=condition=Ready certificate/apps-wildcard-staging
  ```

  Patch ingress controller when certificate is ready inside the secret:
  ```bash
  oc patch ingresscontroller.operator default --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultCertificate": {"name": "apps-wildcard-tls-staging"}}}' -n openshift-ingress-operator
  ```

- **API Server**:

  Verify that the certificate has been successfully retrieved:
  ```bash
  oc wait --timeout=200s -n openshift-config --for=condition=Ready certificate/api-staging
  ```

  Patch apiserver to use this new certificate:
  ```bash
  oc patch apiserver cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"servingCerts": {"namedCertificates": [{"names": ["api.<cluster_name>.<domain>"], "servingCertificate": {"name": "api-tls-staging"}}]}}}'
  ```

### Step 5: Modify kubeconfig

To ensure your Kubernetes client (kubectl) trusts the new certificates, you may need to modify your kubeconfig file. Remove the certificate-authority-data part from your kubeconfig.

```bash
sed -i '/certificate-authority-data/d' kubeconfig
```

### Step 6: Cleanup
If you need to uninstall cert-manager and clean up its resources, use the following commands:

```bash
namespace="cert-manager"
helm uninstall -n ${namespace} cert-manager
oc delete secret -n ${namespace} gandi-credentials

oc delete --ignore-not-found=true -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml

oc delete namespace cert-manager
```

## Why is not the cert-manager operator from OperatorHub used?

The decision to not utilize the cert-manager operator available on OperatorHub stems from a specific limitation regarding the ACME DNS-01 challenge verification process. The core issue is that the cert-manager operator lacks the functionality to specify an alternative DNS service for verifying ACME DNS-01 challenges. By default, cert-manager would resort to using the internal DNS provided by OKD, which is incapable of resolving DNS-01 challenges. This limitation is recognized and tracked in the cert-manager's issue tracker under the ticket titled ["Support configuration via operator subscription"](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/4410).

Furthermore, while Red Hat offers a tailored cert-manager package within OpenShift that includes support for specifying `dns01RecursiveNameservers`, this particular operator version is not available for OKD environments. This discrepancy necessitates our approach of manually installing cert-manager using Helm charts, ensuring we can accurately configure DNS settings to meet our verification needs for ACME DNS-01 challenges.


## Final Remarks

Congratulations on successfully setting up cert-manager with Gandi DNS for your Kubernetes environment. This setup ensures your services are not only securely served over HTTPS but also streamlines the management, issuance, and renewal of certificatesâ€”automating what was once a manual and error-prone process.

### Next Steps

With your certificate infrastructure in place, consider the following to further secure and optimize your environment:
- **Monitor Your Certificates**: Implement monitoring and alerting for certificate expirations and renewals to ensure continuous uptime for your services. Maybe [cert-utils-operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cert-utils-operator) can help you here.
